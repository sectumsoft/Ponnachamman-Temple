            <p>Rakan Nair and Chathan Nair, from the stable Mannatil family in Palakkad district, were tired from walking to the Vaniyamkulam market to buy plowing bullocks. They reached a place called Mankurissi during the night and stayed in a house with the permission of the owners ,a mother and a daughter. On seeing the beautiful, gentle and humble daughter, Rakan Nair, wishing to marry her, persuaded her parents and obtained their consent. <br> On the east side of Peruvemba, he consented to Rakan Nair's marriage in Mannatil (Mazhuvancheri), and went to Mankurissi, gave her a veil according to the tradition, took her and settled her in the house at Mannattil in Peruvemba.Impressed with the girl Rakkan nair asked her to take whatever she wanted from there, she was told that only one lamp was enough, and the people blessed her saying that she would be as bright as the lamp that she had bought, and gave her some places under their control. The family that sprang from them later came to be known as Rakanchath clan.

          <p>Sree Ponnachamman belonged to Rakanchathe family. From 5 families of the district, 6 people including Ponnachamman went to the manakal of a great magician Namboothiri and learned the art of magic. Proficient in Sanskrit, magic and sword practice, Ponnachman used to perform magic only for the sake of merit and good deeds in the family. Incantation and vile incantation, he would not encourage. For that, he is said to have voluntarily amputated his right arm below the elbow, which he needed to cast spells.Every magician has an Upasanamurti, Ponnachhamman's Upasanamurti is Loka Parameshwari Amma. The following people are worshiped in the God's temple seen today.Ittiyasamman was a family member of Ponnachamman. Ponnachamman with him,When going to magic, was taken Muthi Muthassan who was Rakkan Nair, the cause of Mannattil, and Muthassi brought from Mankurissi. We all belong to their lineage. Therefore, the family members of Mannattil have to participate in the puja rituals. Kandakarnan is the temple guardian who guards the gids in the temple. Nagas Commonly, in all clans, Nagas were worshiped come Similarly, in the god temple of Ponnachamman, Naga deities are also worshipped. Puja is performed by Vellari Choriyal, Noorum Paalum. Only Brahmins are allowed to perform puja during the year, during Kalampuja, Maninagam, Karinagam, Nagakanyaka, Chitrakootam, besides these, Brahmarakshas are  also inhabited. Along with Palpayasa, Puja is performed.

          <p>In earlier times, before 1990, Aruthu Puja (Adharma Puja) was performed. In 1990, the Adharma Puja was canceled due to the problem. Earlier, the Nagas had very many female subjects, as dancers. Currently nobody is there in the family to be worshiped as the human form of gods.Ponnachamman had Vatoni Rakanchathe Govindan Nair and Vatoni Rakanchathe Ramankutty Nair as dancers. Since the death of Marankutty Nair in 2006, no one has come. The dancers come from Vatoni Rakanjata families.It will not work if someone does evil magic and evil deeds against family members in our ancestral home. The reason is the presence of Ponnachamman's magic cane which is kept in the temple of God even today. Even today, family members believe that it provides protection against tantra bhuta pishak. <br> Residents of the Tharavad light lamp and offer prayers in the evening before Ponnachamman's statue and other worshiping deities. On Karma Pula days after death of any family member, the Deivapura is closed for 15 days and any of puja karmas are not held at this time. On the day after birth of any child in the family , only lamp is lit. This is being followed as a rule till now.
